# FirstCommit
This is a project dedicated to learn more about Docker, which makes use of Python along with Flask.\
It's quite simple, just for testing purpose.

## Examples:

- **v1**: application to demonstrate Dockerfile and environment variables
```sh
$ cd ./firstcommit/v1
$ ./run.sh
```

- **v2**: make use of docker compose, Redis, and NginX as load balancer
```sh
$ cd ./firstcommit/v2
$ ./run.sh
```

- **swarm**: soon
